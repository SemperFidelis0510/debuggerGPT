  "description_for_model": "As a Python Code Debugging Plugin, I can help you debug Python code files, manage Python environments, and manipulate files on your computer. Before using the plugin, you need to initialize it by running the 'initialize_plugin' function. This function ensures that the conda environment 'debuggerGPT' is set up for running scripts. I can execute shell commands, run Python scripts, and modify files. To debug a code, run the code, examine the output and error messages, decide how to fix the code, and then use the 'modify a file' command to update the code. Repeat this process until the code runs without errors.",

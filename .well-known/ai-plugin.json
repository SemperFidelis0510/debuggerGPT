  "description_for_model": "As a Python Code Debugging Plugin, I can help you debug Python code files, manage Python environments, and manipulate files on your computer. Before using the plugin, you need to initialize it by running the 'initialize_plugin' function. This function ensures that a conda environment is set up for running scripts. The default environment is 'debuggerGPT', but you can specify a different one during initialization or when running a script. I can execute shell commands, run Python scripts, install Python packages, and modify files. To debug a code, run the code, examine the output and error messages, decide how to fix the code, and then use the 'modify a file' command to update the code. Repeat this process until the code runs without errors. Before running a script for the first time, I will check the code for non-native dependencies and ensure they are installed in the chosen environment.",

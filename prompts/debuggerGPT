init

Then, I want you to help me improve and debug the chatGPT plugin 'debugger', you are using, which I created.
The code of the plugin is located in the folder: P:\Scripts\debuggerGPT. Please inspect this folder.
The main files of the project, which you need first to inspect, are 'main.py', 'functions.py' and 'openapi.yaml'.
Do not output the codes, just read their content.

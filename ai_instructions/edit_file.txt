Modify Files: The 'edit_file' function is used to modify a file. It takes a file path, a list of changes (or "fixes") to make, and a method for applying the changes. Here's a more detailed breakdown:
'filename': This is the path to the file you want to modify.

'fixes': This is a list of changes you want to make. Each change is represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

'line': This is the line number where you want to make the change. If you want to change a range of lines, provide the start and end line numbers.
'content': This is the new content you want to insert at the specified line.
'method': This is how you want to apply the changes. It can be one of the following:

'replace': This replaces the content at the specified line with the new content.
'insert': This adds the new content at the specified line, shifting existing lines down.
'new': This creates a new file with the given name in the path, or overwrites an existing file. Make sure to give the complete content if you use this method.
Here's an example of how to use 'edit_file':

To replace line 10 with 'print("Hello, world!")', you would use:
{
"filename": "path/to/your/file.py",
"fixes": [
{
"line": 10,
"content": 'print("Hello, world!")'
}
],
"method": "replace"
}
Remember to always ask for user permission before making changes to a file.

The 'analyze_code' function provides a detailed analysis of a Python code file. It includes the number of lines, the functions defined, the content of the code, and the dependencies needed to run the code.

You should save the following information in your local memory:

'code_path': The path of the code file currently in focus.
'length': The length of the code file, measured in lines.
'main_purpose': A brief description of what the code file is intended to do.
'functions': A list of all the functions defined in the code file, with a brief description of what each function does.

If you want to edit the code, use the 'edit_file' function. This function takes a filename and a list of 'fixes'. Each 'fix' is a dictionary that specifies the lines to be replaced, the new code, and the indentation level. The function also takes an optional 'method' argument, which can be 'subs' (substitute), 'insert', or 'replace'.

If you want to analyze the code at a deeper level, specify a 'scope_level' when calling the 'analyze_code' function. The default 'scope_level' is 2, which includes the code and basic information about it. If you specify a 'scope_level' of 3, the function will also return information about the classes in the code, any comments, the output of a pylint analysis, the cyclomatic complexity of the code, and Halstead metrics.

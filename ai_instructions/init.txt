As a Python Code Debugging Plugin, I can help you debug Python code files,
manage Python environments, and manipulate files on your computer.
Here are the main capabilities and how to use them:

1) Initialization: Before using the plugin, initialize it by running the 'initialize_plugin' function.
This function sets up a conda environment for running scripts. The default environment is 'debuggerGPT',
but you can specify a different one during initialization or when running a script.

2) Execute Shell Commands: You can ask me to 'execute a command' and provide the command as a string.
If you want to run the command in a specific environment, include the 'env_name' in your request.

3) Run Python Scripts: You can ask me to 'run a Python script in a specific environment'
and provide the path to the script and the name of the environment. Before running a script for the first time,
I will check the code for non-native dependencies and ensure they are installed in the chosen environment.

4) Modify Files: You can use the 'modify a file' command to update the local file of the code.

5) Install Python Packages: You can ask me to 'install Python packages' and provide a list of packages to install in a specific environment.

6) Debug Code: To debug a code, run the code, examine the output and error messages,
decide how to fix the code, and then use the 'modify a file' command to update the code.
Repeat this process until the code runs without errors.

7) Analyze Code: You can use the 'analyze_code' function to get a detailed analysis of a Python code file.
This includes the number of lines, the functions defined in the code, the code content, and the dependencies needed to run the code.

8) Download Files: You can use the 'download_file' function to download a file from a given URL and save it to a specified local path.

9) List Files: The 'list_files' function can be used to list all the files in a specified folder.

10) Memory Management: The 'remember' and 'recall' functions can be used to store and retrieve data in the plugin's memory.
This can be useful for storing data that needs to be accessed across multiple requests.

11) Text to Speech: The 'speak' function can be used to convert text to speech.
This can be useful for accessibility purposes or for creating audio from text.

12) Speech to Text: The 'listen' function can be used to convert speech to text.
This can be useful for transcribing audio or for voice commands.

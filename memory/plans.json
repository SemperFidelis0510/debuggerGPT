"Plan": [
"1. Python Voice Recording: Use a Python library like SpeechRecognition to continuously record audio from the microphone.",
"2. Voice to Text Translation: Instead of using the recognize_google function from the SpeechRecognition library, we'll use Windows 11's voice access feature to transcribe the recorded audio into text. This will require an AutoHotkey script.",
"3. AutoHotkey Script: Write an AutoHotkey script that continuously captures the output of Windows 11's voice access. This might involve using the ControlGetText command to get the text from the voice access window.",
"4. Inter-process Communication: Use a method of inter-process communication (IPC) to send the captured text from the AutoHotkey script to the Python script. This could be done using a named pipe, a socket, or a file.",
"5. Python IPC Handler: Write a function in the Python script that reads the text sent by the AutoHotkey script and processes it as if it were transcribed by the SpeechRecognition library.",
"6. Keyword Extraction: Check the beginning of the transcribed text for a keyword that matches one of the keys in your dictionary.",
"7. Function Execution: If a keyword is found, use the exec function to execute the corresponding Python function. The argument to the function should be the rest of the transcribed text, excluding the keyword.",
"8. Adding New Pairs to the Dictionary: Write a function that adds new keyword-function pairs to the dictionary. The function should take two arguments: the keyword and the function name.",
"9. Creating New Python Functions: Write a function that creates a new Python function from a string. The function should use the exec function to define the new function.",
"10. Integration: Integrate the Python and AutoHotkey scripts so that they work together. This might involve starting the AutoHotkey script from the Python script, or vice versa.",
"11. Continuous Operation: Ensure that the system operates continuously, listening for voice commands, transcribing them, and executing the corresponding functions.",
"12. Error Handling: Implement error handling to ensure that the system can recover from potential issues, such as network errors during voice transcription or syntax errors in the dynamically created Python functions.",
"13. Testing and Debugging: Test the system thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Debug any issues that arise."
